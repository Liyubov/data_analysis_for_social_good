# Data analysis methods 

Here we apply the following data analysis methods to work on various problems. 
The methods we are using are mostly based on:

1. network theory

2. stochastic processes 
https://github.com/Liyubov/networks_random_walking

Repository for analysis of mobility data and trajectories analysis https://github.com/Liyubov/mobility_analysis


Projects, which inspired creation of this repository:

1. Unicef school mapping project 
https://www.unicef.org/innovation/school-mapping

2. Lecturers without borders project, hosted at CRI 
www.scied.network 

3. Open global mobility data 
from https://bluehub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/migration/app/index.html?state=5cc845a97758cd17cdecd1fb 


# Data visualisation 

First of all we start with visualisation of the data. 
The notebooks here are dedicated to data visualisation and data analysis

### data_on_map_visualisation.ipynb 

We visualise the csv file with data on a map. The example of data are randomized data from educational centres around the world. 
Due to the data privacy reasons we are visualising only in the average characteristics of the data, such as average number of data points and average parameters of datapoints (such as number of resources needed in datapoints etc.).

### mobilitydata analyzer.ipynb 

We analyze the mobility data from open global mobility data. (work in progress)


### trajectory analyzer.ipynb 
(work in progress for analysis of individual trajectories)
