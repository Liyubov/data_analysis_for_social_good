# Data analysis methods 

We introduce some data analysis methods to work on various problems. 
We use various methods, mostly focusing on:

1. using network theory

2. stochastic processes

Repository for analysis of mobility data and trajectories analysis https://github.com/Liyubov/mobility_analysis


Projects, which inspired creation of this repository:

1. Unicef school mapping project 
https://www.unicef.org/innovation/school-mapping

2. Lecturers without borders project, hosted at CRI 
www.scied.network 

3. Open global mobility data 
from https://bluehub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/migration/app/index.html?state=5cc845a97758cd17cdecd1fb 


# Data visualisation 

First of all we start with visualisation of the data. 
The notebooks here are dedicated to data visualisation and data analysis

### data_on_map_visualisation.ipynb 

We visualise the csv file with data on a map. The example of data are randomized data from educational centres around the world. 
Due to the data privacy reasons we are showing the data only in the cases when data is open access. 

### mobilitydata analyzer.ipynb 

We analyze the mobility data from global mobility data. (work in progress)
